## A fun open playground to create a Halloween/Fall themed website! Check the [issues tab](https://github.com/MilSpouseCoders/Hacktoberfest_2020_Halloween/issues) for ideas of where to start!

### A few notes:
- The website is hosted using GitHub pages and a `npm run deploy` script (that a project maintainer will run).  
- If you are using Visual Studio Code, it is recommended to use a [live previewer extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=george-alisson.html-preview-vscode) (Toggle Preview - ctrl+shift+v or cmd+shift+v) or check your progress by opening the .html file in your browser.


### For those completely new to GitHub, check out the resources [here](https://milspousecoders.github.io/MSC-Coding-Resources/learn-git.html) and read the [MilSpouse Coders' Hacktoberfest Setup](https://github.com/MilSpouseCoders/Hacktoberfest_2020/blob/master/SETUP.md)!
